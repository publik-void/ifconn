Simple network interface control shell script.

Main use case: Automatically reconnect `wlan0` Wi-Fi interface on a Raspberry Pi
when connection has stopped working, as it tends to do at times.

For futher details, see the usage message in the actual
link:./ifconn.sh[script file] (more easily viewed by running `ifconn.sh
--help`).
